                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text-muted);">
                    When Grandpa started Glenwood in 1970, he wasn’t thinking of your typical trailer park. He was
                    thinking of his trips to Florida each year when he and Grandma would load up their little trailer
                    and take 2 weeks to drive to Briny Breezes mobile home community, where they would winter. If they
                    were lucky, they would make 100 miles in one day. Grandpa wasn’t in a hurry.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text-muted); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    In Briny, they would relax with their friends in a beautiful 55 and above mobile home community
                    right on the beach. They loved being in a friendly neighborhood with people their age. So Grandpa
                    thought, why not do this in my home town? He didn’t have a beach, but he did own 120 acres of
                    beautiful land in a country setting. Being a civil engineer, he began drawing up plans for a new
                    kind of mobile home community.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text-muted); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    He didn’t want mobile homes jammed up next to each other. He figured people want a little elbow
                    room, maybe a garden. So he built quarter acre lots. Or about. Bigger than any nearby residential
                    neighborhoods. Underground utilities for a cleaner look. Big areas of green space, lots of trees.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text-muted); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    He took his time. He built 4 lots a year, max. He carefully supervised the landscaping of each lot
                    to make sure water flowed away from each home. No sewer or water line was backfilled until he
                    carefully checked it out. He loved building something beautiful, working outside.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text-muted); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    People lined up to get in. They paid rent, but not property taxes. They got a home at half the price
                    of one in neighboring subdivisions, with rent that was lower than their neighbor’s residential
                    property tax.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text-muted); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    But after 43 lots, age began to catch up with Grandpa. Amazingly, he had begun Glenwood when he was
                    74. He and Grandma passed away and left it to my sister and me. We wanted to continue the great
                    model he had begun. So in 1995 I began building 20 more lots. To improve the quality of homes in
                    Glenwood, we began setting up our own new homes and selling them. I love working with my chain saw,
                    so tree trimming and planting accelerated. Each year the community kept improving. I think Grandpa
                    would be pleased.
                </p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; color: var(--color-primary); margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">A New Generation</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text-muted);">
                    So what do you do when you inherit a mobile home community? For me the answer was easy. You buy a
                    chain saw and start cutting down trees. Lots of trees. That cute little sapling that someone planted
                    10 feet from their home 25 years ago is now a giant silver maple towering over their home and
                    dropping branches all over. With such big lots, there was plenty of room for trees and they had been
                    planted with abandon. But now some residents were concerned with these monsters lurking so close to
                    their homes. Many dying or dangerous trees needed to be removed. It was time to replace the messy
                    silver maples with majestic sawtooth oaks and the infected purple plums with redbuds or crabapple
                    varieties.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text-muted); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    At first, I was just happy to be able to fell a tree without killing myself. It’s incredible how
                    many things can go wrong when you drop a tall tree. If it’s leaning it can barber chair (dangerous),
                    if it’s rotten it can break off unexpectedly (very dangerous), if it’s windy it can fall the wrong
                    direction (unbelievably dangerous). I learned the plunge cut, the importance of the hinge, wedges.
                    And I began planting new trees from a local nursery. In one year alone, 77 beautiful new trees were
                    planted.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text-muted); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    But trees were just the beginning of my new job. It turns out that backhoes are amazingly fun.
                    Repairing electric, water and sewer lines is quite interesting if you have the right equipment. In
                    1995 I expanded Glenwood by building 20 more lots. And as I learned more about manufactured homes
                    and attended the annual Louisville Manufactured Housing trade show, it seemed it might be better if
                    I could bring in homes more appropriate for each particular lot. Many Glenwood lots have great views
                    out the back, so I bought homes suitable for back decks and windows facing the open space. And I
                    could also control the quality of the installation this way. I used the best contractors and
                    carefully installed each new home.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text-muted); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    With new homes and better landscaping, Glenwood looked better each year. And it turns out for me
                    that running Glenwood is way more fun than sitting in a cubicle writing software and going to
                    countless boring meetings. So maybe this will work out. Drop by sometime and we can talk about your
                    favorite chain saw.
